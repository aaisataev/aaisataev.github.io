# Intro

Steve Jobs was still alive when I got my first iPhone and had just died when I got my brand-new Macbook Pro.

A couple of years later, bored of playing Angry Birds, I became an iOS developer.

And as any great developer would do, I got a developer account, read the documentation, opened XCode and started coding *hello world*.

My name is Assylbek Issatayev. Here I will post my work, ideas and everything else.

Hi all.
